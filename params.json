  "body": "Joy2Chord is a userlevel input driver for chorded keyboards based off of devices that can interface through /dev/input/js*.\r\n\r\n# Requirements:\r\n* Linux uinput interface in kernel\r\n* Linux Joystick interface in kernel\r\n* Some type of joystick or gamepad that plays nicely with linux\r\n\r\n# Currently Implemented Features:\r\n* Multiple Modes for input\r\n* Basic Alpha/Numeric input\r\n* Useful handling of Special characters (alt, shift, ctrl, meta, cap, scroll, num locks ) ( hold all modifiers down untill a non * modifier is pressed )\r\n* Config file support (Basic)\r\n* Calibration assitance ( run with -b and joy2chord will tell you what button number you pressed)\r\n\r\n# Todo:\r\n* macros should be easy to define in config file\r\n* support for key repeating\r\n* Helper application support\r\n\r\n# Similar Software:\r\n* joy2key - joy2key uses x events to send output, if you'd prefer this instead of uinput look at joy2key http://interreality.org/~tetron/technology/joy2key/\r\n*joymouse - translates joystick events to mouse events. http://sourceforge.net/projects/joymouse-linux\r\n* mxk - an input evdev/uinput mangling server, http://welz.org.za/projects/mxk\r\n\r\n#Updates:\r\n\r\n* 5 Apr 08: added support for mapping what joystick button maps to internal program buttons\r\n* 25 Apr 08: Config file support is mostly done now, multiple modes can be defined.\r\n* 4 May 08: Simple config file support completed, button repeat support should work for simple buttons\r\n* 18 Sept 08: added coments to config file and readme to make initial configs easier\r\n* 04 Apr 09: cleaned up all gcc warnings and extracted header information into joy2chord.h\r\n",
